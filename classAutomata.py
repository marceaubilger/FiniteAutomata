        """
        Displays the finite automaton's transition table in a formatted manner.

        The method constructs a table where each row represents a state and each column represents a symbol from the alphabet.
        The table shows the resulting state for each state-symbol pair based on the transitions defined in the automaton.

        The table is printed with the following format:
        - The first row contains the alphabet symbols.
        - Each subsequent row starts with a state and contains the resulting states for each symbol in the alphabet.
        - Empty cells indicate no transition for the corresponding state-symbol pair.

        Example output:
        |  | a| b|
        |q0|q1|  |
        |q1|  |q2|
        |q2|q0|q1|

        Notes: 
        - The table is printed with '|' as the column separator and each row on a new line.
        - The method makes an attempt at aligning the columns, but the output may not be perfectly aligned.
